# steamsales

A webapp that displays the top 100 most played steam games along their pricing and discount information.

Built on React/NextJS/Redux.

Uses the [steam web api](https://steamcommunity.com/dev). All API queries are done via a builtin relay and cached to keep the number of requests down.

I found [this site](https://steamapi.xpaw.me/) useful when figuring out what the API can offer.

Deployed to vercel at:
